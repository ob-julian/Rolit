2-4
## How to Play:
### Game Goal:
Get the most squares
### Turn Goal:
To get strategic squares or chance as many squares to your color as possible.
### Turn:
You place a "O" in an empty square that is connected (-, |, /, \) to other none empty squares.  
Furthermore you need a square in your color that is in a straight line diagonal, horizontal or vertical at least 1 unit away.  
If you draw a straight line in every of the 8 direction and hit a "O" in your color every "O" in between is now your color as well. (happens automatically)

If you are unable to place a "O" by the rules stated above you can put your new "O" in an empty square that is just connected to other none empty squares.
